Only took ferry boat to go to asian side because it us very easy to walk to Galata crossing the bridge by foot (like 10 - 15 minutes beautiful walk). Breakfast is the most wonderful. It is infinite, because of so many choices. Great turkish and European style. They make gluten free food upon request which is wonderful! Jelly of many flavours, about 6 types os cheese and inumerous breads and cakes.

The staff are very welcoming and are always ready to assist you.   We had a minor issue with the room that was allocated to us, however this was resolved by Mr Engin within an hour. Not only that, he upgraded us to a deluxe room which had a wonderful setting and view of Hagia Sophia.   The breakfast service is very high quality food with a wide selection to choose from. You can also order hot Turkish breakfast and Menemen.   The hotel has a swimming pool and gym, hamam which is open from 8am till 10pm.   One of the best things about this hotel is the location. You're in the heart of the historical places, food, culture and people. All the well known restaurants are close by.
