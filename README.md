# Gt_Hack2024


• Built a Retrieval Augmented Generation-based system which takes semantic queries of hotel criteria as inputs
• Used pandas to manipulate and access a designated hotel dataset and Jupyter Notebook to visualize the results
for testing
• Utilized the chromadb embedding model to retrieve searches from the database and a decoder model to explain
preferences to users
